## II. Project Details

### Description 

_DailyDisplay_ is the essential interface for starting your day every morning. The Display is similar to what you see in personal assistants such as Alexa, but within the capabilities of the Arduino Uno, and within the reasonable time frame of ELE206. 

Some features of the _DailyDisplay_ include:

- Weather
- Temperature
- Date
- Time
- Customizable Messaging
- Images
- Drawings
- Bluetooth Capabilities
- And more...

The project is currently in **DEV** stage. All updates will be posted to this repository as soon as they are released to the public. Updates will be consistently uploaded, and can be found in the [**_status_**](https://github.com/evano811/DailyDisplay/tree/main/status) folder.

### Hardware Used

Hardware is essential to the development of our product. We run all of our hardware operations through _Arduino Uno_. All wiring will be submitted by _image_, titled with dates of editing history. Below each image will contain a short description displaying:

- Components Used
- Connections
- Bugs/Fixes
- Whats Next

A list of all other parts and their descriptions, usages and other information can be found in the [**_parts_**](https://github.com/evano811/DailyDisplay/tree/main/parts) folder.

### Software Used

All software will be developed using the Arduino IDE with .ino files. A list of all code used per date will be submitted to this repository, along with a short description displaying:

- What the code accomplishes
- What needs to be fixed
- What needs to be added

All source code and method information can be found in the  [**_src_**](https://github.com/evano811/DailyDisplay/tree/main/src) folder. 

### Deadline and Deliverables

Our project has the following deadlines:

- **PRESENTATION** - _April 22nd/24th_
