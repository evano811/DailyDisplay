# DailyDisplay Project Timeline and Status Updates

## April 1 - The Birth of DailyDisplay

- Idea solidified and proposal submitted (No access at the moment, currently working to fix)
- Parts List Submitted to Dr. Solanski (Also needs an update, will upload as soon as possible)

## April 4 - Meeting 1

- Diagram of Hardware Drawn
- Pseudocode ideas thrown around, however there is nothing we can currently do without our hardware not being shipped in yet.
- Idea confirmed with TA, switched from initial 4-8x8 Matrix Display to 20x4 Liquid Crystal Display for easier connections and cleaner presentation.
- Plan is to have general idea of codes and connections by **April 11th**
- _Will not be in lab 4/11 - Flying to Wisconsin_
